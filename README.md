# Tic Tac Toe

Tic tac toe is a classic paper-pencil game played among young children across the world, and it’s widely known for its simple rules. It is played by marking an X or an O on a 3x3 grid. The first person to mark three of their signs in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row, wins the game. 

But today, we will be making a text-based tic tac toe game in Python, for you to enjoy with your friends and family!
